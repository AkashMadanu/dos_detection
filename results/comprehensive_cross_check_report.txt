COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT CROSS-CHECK REPORT
==========================================

Date: September 1, 2025
Project: XAI Powered DoS Prevention System
Current Status: Step 2 Feature Engineering (5/6 sub-steps completed)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================

We have successfully completed 83% of Step 2 Feature Engineering, transforming our initial 42 raw network features into 10 scientifically-validated, statistically-significant features optimized for DoS detection. All work has been validated and cross-checked for accuracy.

DETAILED PROGRESS VERIFICATION
===============================

STEP 1: DATASET CREATION - COMPLETED AND VERIFIED
--------------------------------------------------

Initial State:
- Raw UNSW-NB15 dataset files available
- Mixed attack types and normal traffic
- Unbalanced data distribution

Completed Work:
- Extracted DoS-specific attacks from full dataset
- Created balanced dataset: 4,089 DoS + 4,089 Normal = 8,178 total records
- Verified 50/50 perfect balance for binary classification
- Output: dos_detection_dataset.csv (8,178 rows x 45 columns)

Validation Status: VERIFIED - Dataset exists and is properly balanced

STEP 2: FEATURE ENGINEERING - IN PROGRESS (83% COMPLETE)
---------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2.1: DATA CLEANUP - COMPLETED AND VERIFIED
-----------------------------------------------

Purpose: Remove administrative clutter, organize structure
Input: dos_detection_dataset.csv (8,178 x 45 columns)
Process: 
- Removed 'id' column (just row numbers, not useful)
- Removed 'attack_cat' column (redundant with 'label')
- Kept 'label' as target variable (0=Normal, 1=DoS)
- Organized 42 input features + 1 target variable

Output: cleaned_dataset.csv (8,178 x 43 columns)
Feature Count: 42 features maintained (NO reduction, structure only)
Data Integrity: 8,178 records preserved, 50/50 balance maintained

Validation Status: VERIFIED - File exists, correct structure confirmed

STEP 2.2: CATEGORICAL ENCODING - COMPLETED AND VERIFIED
-------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Convert text features to numbers for ML compatibility
Input: cleaned_dataset.csv (42 features, mixed text/numeric)
Process:
- Encoded 'proto' field: tcp=0, udp=1, arp=2, etc.
- Encoded 'service' field: http=0, ftp=1, dns=2, etc.
- Encoded 'state' field: FIN=0, INT=1, CON=2, etc.
- All other features already numeric

Output: encoded_dataset.csv (8,178 x 43 columns)
Feature Count: 42 features maintained (NO reduction, conversion only)
Data Integrity: All features now numeric, ML-compatible

Validation Status: VERIFIED - All features confirmed numeric

STEP 2.3: CORRELATION ANALYSIS - COMPLETED AND CORRECTED
---------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Remove redundant features with high correlation (>0.90)
Input: encoded_dataset.csv (42 features)

INITIAL ANALYSIS (HAD ERRORS):
- Found 10 highly correlated pairs
- Made several wrong decisions in smart selection
- User questioned the decisions (CORRECTLY)

CORRECTION APPLIED:
- Re-analyzed all correlated pairs with statistical evidence
- Applied proper decision criteria:
  * Higher F-statistic (better discrimination)
  * Lower p-value (statistical significance)
  * Better effect size

CORRECTED DECISIONS:
- tcprtt vs synack: FIXED - Kept tcprtt (F=380.55 vs F=346.59)
- sbytes vs spkts: FIXED - Kept sbytes (p=0.001 vs p=0.175)
- is_ftp_login vs ct_ftp_cmd: IMPROVED - Better selection
- Other pairs: Maintained correct decisions

Output: decorrelated_dataset_corrected.csv (8,178 x 35 columns)
Feature Count: 42 → 34 features (8 removed, 19% reduction)
Features Removed: 8 (dloss, dpkts, ct_ftp_cmd, sloss, swin, spkts, is_sm_ips_ports, synack)

Validation Status: VERIFIED AND CORRECTED - Statistical evidence confirms better decisions

STEP 2.4: VARIANCE ANALYSIS - COMPLETED AND VERIFIED
----------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Remove low-variance uninformative features
Input: decorrelated_dataset_corrected.csv (34 features)
Process:
- Analyzed variance of all features
- Identified quasi-constant features (≥95% same value)
- Identified low unique features (<1% unique values)
- Applied smart filtering criteria

Analysis Results:
- Zero variance features: 0 (good data quality)
- Quasi-constant features: 1 (is_ftp_login with 99.4% zeros)
- Low unique features: 16 total

Features Removed (16 total):
1. is_ftp_login (99.4% same value)
2-16. Various ct_* features, sttl, dttl, state, service, etc. (all <1% unique)

Output: variance_cleaned_dataset.csv (8,178 x 19 columns)
Feature Count: 34 → 18 features (16 removed, 47.1% reduction)
Data Integrity: Perfect preservation, sklearn verification passed

Validation Status: VERIFIED - Significant improvement in feature quality

STEP 2.5: STATISTICAL TESTING - COMPLETED AND VERIFIED
------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Select only statistically significant features that distinguish DoS from Normal
Input: variance_cleaned_dataset.csv (18 features)
Process:
- ANOVA F-tests for statistical significance
- Mutual Information analysis for information content
- Random Forest importance for practical predictive power
